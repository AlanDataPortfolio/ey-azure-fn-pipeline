An ambulance was called to the scene, but injuries were not severe.","70","Based on the provided claim details, here are the key indicators that suggest a potential risk of fraud:

1. **Claim Amount**: The total claim amount of $20,000 for a minor damage incident involving three vehicles and only one reported minor bodily injury appears disproportionately high.

2. **Incident Severity vs. Claim Amount**: The incident is classified as a multi-vehicle collision with minor damage but involves a significant claim amount, which raises suspicion.

3. **Customer History**: The claimant has been a customer for 74 months, but there is no additional detail on prior claims, which could provide context for their reliability.

4. **Involvement of Emergency Services**: An ambulance was called for what is described as minor injuries. This could indicate potential exaggeration or an attempt to increase the claim amount.

5. **Number of Vehicles Involved vs. Nature of Damage**: Multi-vehicle collisions often result in higher damage claims. Still, the description provided suggests minor impacts, which may not justify such a high claim.

Based on these factors, the likelihood of fraud in this claim is estimated at **70%**. The significant discrepancy between the nature of the incident and the claim amount raises substantial concerns.","ai indicated that claim amount is very high for the type of crash.

**Claim Details:**
- **Claim ID:** 5
- **Claim Amount:** $6,000
- **Incident Type:** Single Vehicle Collision
- **Incident Severity:** Major Loss
- **Time as Customer:** 23 years
- **Driver Age:** 40
- **Bodily Injuries:** 1
- **Authorities Involved:** Ambulance
- **Police Report:** Yes

**Key Indicators:**
1. **Claim Amount vs. Incident Severity:**
   - A major loss in a single vehicle collision with a $6,000 claim amount is relatively low for significant damage, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the described losses.

2. **Customer History:**
   - Long-term customer (23 years), which generally reduces fraud risk, but does not eliminate it.

3. **Consistency in Description:**
   - Claimant's description of losing control aligns with the collision type, but the degree of damage versus claim amount seems inconsistent.

4. **Incident Details:**
   - An ambulance was called, indicating potential seriousness of injuries; however, only one bodily injury reported raises questions when matched with ""major"" incident severity.

### Fraud Likelihood Estimate: 
**Estimated Fraud Likelihood: 25%**

**Reasoning:**
While there are factors such as long customer history that suggest low fraud risk, the inconsistency between reported damages and claim amount along with potentially inflated descriptions of severity raise suspicion. However, the existence of police involvement and only minor injuries diminishes the likelihood significantly.","AI suggested 25% chance of fraud.
Given the score is low, I am approving this case.

**Key Indicators:**
- **Claim Amount:** $45,000 for minor damage is unusually high. Typically, minor collisions result in much lower claims.
- **Incident Type:** Multi-vehicle collision; while not inherently suspicious, the high claim amount raises flags.
- **Customer History:** The claimant has been a customer for 91 months, indicating a longstanding relationship, but this does not negate the high claim amount.
- **Consistency with Description:** Although the description mentions minor damage and police involvement, the lack of a police report and the significant claim amount create inconsistency. 

**Conclusion:**
The combination of a high claim amount for minor damage and the absence of a police report raises substantial concerns. 

**Estimated Fraud Likelihood: 70%** 

This percentage reflects the discrepancies and unusual nature of the claim compared to typical outcomes in similar incidents.","After looking at claim analysis summary, it is a very high fraud risk score 70%.
I am thus escalating claim ID 6."

The fire department had to respond due to a fire hazard","65","Based on the provided claim details, the following key indicators suggest potential fraud risk:

1. **Claim Amount**: The total claim amount of $52,270 for a multi-vehicle collision with total loss is significantly high, particularly considering that there are no reported bodily injuries. This raises questions about the validity of the damages claimed.

2. **Incident Severity & Police Report**: The incident is classified as a total loss with significant response involvement from the fire department, yet there is no police report. The absence of a police report in such severe incidents is unusual and could indicate potential misrepresentation of the event.

3. **Customer History**: While the customer has a long tenure (316 days) and appears to be responsible (no vehicle age or driver experience concerns), the other indicators may outweigh this positive history.

4. **Consistency with Description**: The claim description mentions a fire hazard leading to a total loss, which aligns with fire department involvement. However, the lack of reported injuries and police documentation creates a discrepancy.

Given these factors, especially the high claim amount, absence of a police report, and inconsistency in incident details, the likelihood of fraud is assessed at **65%**. This suggests a significant risk that the claim may not be entirely legitimate.","Escalate because high fraud risk"

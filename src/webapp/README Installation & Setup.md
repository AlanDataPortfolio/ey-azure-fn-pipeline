# README for Building and Running the Web App

## Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio Code (VSC)**: Ensure Visual Studio Code is installed. [Download VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Node.js**: Required to run the Next.js application. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Next.js Library**: Installed within your Visual Studio Code environment.

## Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanDataPortfolio/ey-azure-fn-pipeline.git
```

Navigate to the `webapp` folder in Visual Studio Code.

## Install Required Dependencies
Before running the web app, ensure all necessary libraries and imports are installed:

### Libraries and Imports Used
- **React Hooks**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  ```
- **Routing**:
  ```javascript
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
  ```
- **Markdown Rendering**:
  ```javascript
  import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';
  import remarkBreaks from 'remark-breaks';
  ```
- **HTTP Requests**:
  ```javascript
  const axios = require('axios'); // or
  import axios from 'axios';
  ```

### Installation Command
Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and navigate to the `webapp` directory, then run:
```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all dependencies as listed in the `package.json` file, ensuring that the imported libraries are correctly set up.

## Run the Development Server
Start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Accessing the App
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```
This link takes you directly to the login page of the web app.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Ensure Node.js version compatibility**: Confirm that your Node.js version is compatible with the libraries being used.
- **Check for import errors**: If the app fails to compile, make sure all libraries (such as `axios`, `react-markdown`, and `remark-breaks`) are correctly imported and installed.
